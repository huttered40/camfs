We merge the **CANDMC** library with new algorithms for Cholesky factorization and QR factorization.

Optimized parallel schedules and algorithms for:
* LU
* Cholesky
* QR
* Eigen-decomposition

Highlights include:
* Communication-avoiding Cholesky QR2
* Pipelined Communication-avoiding QR
* Symmetric full-to-band reduction with communication-avoiding QR
